            <h3>What about me ? - I'm not good at this !</h3>
            <p>I'm hoping to get back into an IT position by doing an on-line Full-Stack Engineer course for a year.</p>
            <p>I have worked in various places during my career in IT – Aldgate East, Central and west London, the City,
                Dockland’s, Croydon, Leatherhead, Bedford, Flitwick, Bournemouth and Falmouth.
            <p>I have lived in the South West of the UK - Middlesex, Surrey, Hampshire, Cornwall and Buckinghamshire.
            </p>
            <p>I am on my second marriage and have two grow up daughters from my first marriage.</P>
            <p>My second wife is Gambian and has lived in the UK with me for over 5 years but she doesn’t have her
                “indefinite leave to remain” in the UK yet.</p>
            <p>I like long walks (at least 5 to 10 miles), DIY and anything to do with Computers.</p>
            <p>I don’t like anti-social inconsiderate behaviour (we all live on the same planet), competency based
                interview questions and day-time TV.</p>
